		<p class="movieDetail">Pushpa 2: The Rule is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language action drama film[6] directed by Sukumar and produced by Mythri Movie Makers, in association with Sukumar Writings. The film stars Allu Arjun in the titular role, alongside Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh Faasil, Jagapathi Babu, Dhananjaya, Rao Ramesh, Sunil and Anasuya Bharadwaj. It is the second instalment in the Pushpa film series and the sequel to the 2021 film Pushpa: The Rise. The film follows Pushpa, a coolie risen to the ranks of sandalwood smuggler, who struggles to sustain his business as he faces tough opposition from the police led by Shekhawat.

The sequel was officially announced a few days prior to the original film's release in December 2021, under Pushpa 2, while the subtitle Pushpa 2: The Rule was announced in August 2022.[7][8] 10% of the film's footage was initially shot back-to-back with the original film. However, Sukumar decided to alter the story, which led to the film's principal photography commencing in October 2022. The film has music composed by Devi Sri Prasad, cinematography handled by Mirosław Kuba Brożek and editing by Naveen Nooli. Made on a budget of ₹400–500 crore,[3][9] the film is one of the most expensive Indian films. With a runtime of 200 minutes,[10] it is one of the longest Indian films ever made.</p>
